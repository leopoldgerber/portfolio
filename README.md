# Leopold Gerber - Data Analytics | Data Scientist Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Leopold Gerber - but you can call me Leo - and I am a Junior Data Analyst.

As an analyst, I've encountered all kinds of tasks, from unloading target groups and automating reports, all the way to full-fledged scripting, taking cost savings into account for the company. 

In addition to working cases, in my portfolio you can find competitive projects on Kaggle, as well as training projects from data analysis courses.
I created this repository to showcase my hard skills and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science.

### Project Car Price Predict
[Notebook](Project%20Car%20Price%20Predict.ipynb)
#### Description: 
##### The poject contains three datasets: 
<p> a natural dataset that has been filled since 2014, a parsed dataset from 2019 and a test dataset from 2021. The total number of records is 254265. All three datasets have different values within the attributes/columns (according to the test dataset the columns count ~ 27). The project includes the following steps: import necessary libraries, defining the main functions, data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing the statistical significance (One-Way Anova), hypothesis testing (F-critical, T-critical and p-value - three methods included), measuring statistical factors, finding outliers, feature engineering, data visualization, testing five ML models with MAPE. Participation in the kaggle competition.
Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization, feature engineering, machine learning.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Sklearn, CatBoost, RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, XGBRegressor, StackingRegressor.
Results: A predictive model has been created, the speed of processing requests has increased - resulting in increased profits.
