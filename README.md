# Leopold Gerber - Data Analytics | Data Scientist Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Leopold Gerber - but you can call me Leo - and I am a Junior Data Analyst.

As an analyst, I've encountered all kinds of tasks, from unloading target groups and automating reports, all the way to full-fledged scripting, taking cost savings into account for the company. 

In addition to working cases, in my portfolio you can find competitive projects on Kaggle, as well as training projects from data analysis courses.
I created this repository to showcase my hard skills and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science.
